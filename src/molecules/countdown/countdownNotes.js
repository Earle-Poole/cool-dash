// What I want/need to do:

// form 2 input fields ***done

// 1-name of event ***done 

// 2-date of event we are counting to ***done

// calculate the current date and time (in ms) ***done

// calculate the date and time of the event date (in ms) ***done

// subtract the difference in ms to know how long till our event date ***done

// convert the difference in ms to years, months, days, hours, mins, sec ***done

// set state ***done

// be able to select multiple events to count down to ***done

// save to local storage ***done

// delete individual countdowns from storage and state ***done

// tell the timer to 'tick' after every second ***done



// Still needs to be worked on...

// style the timer

// when count down has finished display: something to the effect of "it is '' today!"

// make fireworks go off when it's the event day
